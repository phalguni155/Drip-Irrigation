Project Description
-------------------

The Project presented here waters your plants regularly when you are out for vocation. 
In this the irrigation will take place only when there will be intense requirement of water using automatic 
microcontroller embedded system.

The project is to implement the idea of automating the watering phase of gardening using conceal drip irrigation 
technique to conserve manpower, water and improve the growth, quality and yield of plants. The proposed system is an
embedded system which will closely monitor and control the various soil parameters of a greenhouse on a regular basis
for cultivation of crops or specific plant species or large natural turfs which could maximize their production over 
the whole crop growth season and to eliminate the difficulties involved in the system by reducing human intervention
to the best possible extent. The system comprises of sensors, Analog to Digital Converter, microcontroller and pump.
